task: FrankaReach
env_name: franka_reach
description: This task involves controlling a 7-DOF Franka Panda robot to reach 
  randomly positioned spherical targets within its workspace while handling random 
  joint failures. The robot must simultaneously achieve two objectives - 
  reaching the target position with its end-effector and correctly identifying which 
  joint has failed during the episode. Joint failures can occur at random times 
  and completely lock the affected joint's motion.
